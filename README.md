A simple RSS archiving tool. 

Takes a JSON Google Reader RSS archive and dumps the contents to a SQLite DB and downloads all referenced images. Support for repeated scraping of RSS/Atom coming soon.

Written as a fun little exercise in one afternoon, so don't expect it to be terribly cleverly written or appropriate for actual use. I'm also a rendering/graphics guy, not a web guy, so doubly don't expect this to be terribly clever.

Requires [CherryPy](cherrypy.org) and Python 2.x where x is 7 or higher.
